# Google-Map-in-Flutter

In this short article, we will create an app that renders markers on Google map from JSON file.

With the Google Maps Flutter plugin, you can add maps based on Google maps data to your application. The plugin automatically handles access to the Google Maps servers, map display, and response to user gestures such as clicks and drags. You can also add markers to your map. These objects provide additional information for map locations and allow the user to interact with the map.
